# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator.

#env:
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
  #TERM: xterm-256color

window:
  # Window dimensions (changes require restart)

  # Specified in number of columns/lines, not pixels.
  # If both are `0`, this setting is ignored.
  dimensions:
    columns: 0

  # Window padding (changes require restart)
  #
  # Blank space added around the window in pixels. This padding is scaled
  # by DPI and the specified value is always added at both opposing sides.
  padding:
    x: 4
    y: 4

  # Spread additional padding evenly around the terminal content.
  dynamic_padding: false

  # Window decorations
  #
  # Values for `decorations`:
  #     - full: Borders and title bar
  #     - none: Neither borders nor title bar
  #
  # Values for `decorations` (macOS only):
  #     - transparent: Title bar, transparent background and title bar buttons
  #     - buttonless: Title bar, transparent background, but no title bar buttons
  decorations: full

  # When true, alacritty starts maximized.
  startup_mode: Fullscreen

scrolling:
  # Maximum number of lines in the scrollback buffer.
  # Specifying '0' will disable scrolling.

  # Number of lines the viewport will move for every line scrolled when
  # scrollback is enabled (history > 0).

# Font configuration (changes require restart)
font:

    #   - (macOS) Menlo
    #   - (Linux) monospace
    #   - (Windows) Consolas
    family: Source Code Pro

    # The `style` can be specified to pick a specific face.
    #style: Regular

  # Bold font face
  #bold:
    # Font family
    #
    # If the bold family is not specified, it will fall back to the
    # value specified for the normal font.
    #family: monospace

    # The `style` can be specified to pick a specific face.
    #style: Bold

  # Italic font face
  #italic:
    # Font family
    #
    # If the italic family is not specified, it will fall back to the
    # value specified for the normal font.
    #family: monospace

    # The `style` can be specified to pick a specific face.
    #style: Italic

  # Point size
  size: 14 # 11.0

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought of
  # as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter spacing.
  offset:
    x: 0
    y: 5

  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with
  # the default being at the bottom. Increasing `x` moves the glyph to the right,
  # increasing `y` moves the glyph upwards.

    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Thin stroke font rendering (macOS only)
  #
  # Thin strokes are suitable for retina displays, but for non-retina screens
  # it is recommended to set `use_thin_strokes` to `false`
  #
  # macOS >= 10.14.x:
  #
  # If the font quality on non-retina display looks bad then set
  # `use_thin_strokes` to `true` and enable font smoothing by running the
  # following command:
  #   `defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO`
  #
  # This is a global setting and will require a log out or restart to take
  # effect.
